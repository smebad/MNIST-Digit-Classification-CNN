# üß† MNIST Digit Classification

## üìò Project Overview

This project focuses on building a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model to classify hand-written digits (0‚Äì9) from the popular MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset includes 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each a 28x28 grayscale image of a single digit. Our goal is to accurately classify these images using deep learning techniques.

### üöÄ Steps in This Project:
1. **Data Loading and Exploration**  
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Reshaping, normalizing, and converting labels to categorical data.
3. **Model Building**: Constructing a CNN model for image classification.
4. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Training the model, evaluating performance, and analyzing results.
5. **Model Visualization**: Plotting training and validation accuracy and loss.
6. **Model Testing**: Generating predictions and analyzing results with a confusion matrix and classification report.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Structure

### 1. Import Libraries
- Libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, and Matplotlib are essential for building, training, and visualizing our CNN model.

### 2. Load the Dataset
- The MNIST dataset is loaded using Keras, which directly provides the training and test sets.

### 3. Data Exploration
- We explore the shape of the data and plot an example image to understand our dataset better.

### 4. Data Preprocessing
- **Reshaping**: Adds a channel dimension to the images (required for CNN).
- **Normalization**: Scales pixel values to the range [0, 1] for efficient training.
- **One-Hot Encoding**: Transforms labels into a format suitable for classification.

### 5. Model Building üèóÔ∏è
The CNN architecture includes:
- **Conv2D Layers**: Extract patterns and features from the images.
- **MaxPooling Layers**: Reduce the data size, retaining only essential features.
- **Flatten**: Convert data into a single vector for decision-making.
- **Dense Layers**: Fully connected layers for classification.
- **Dropout Layer**: Prevents overfitting by randomly ignoring some nodes during training.

### 6. Model Training
- We train the model over 10 epochs with training and validation data to observe learning patterns.

### 7. Model Evaluation üìä
- The model is evaluated on test data to gauge its generalization ability. Metrics like accuracy and loss are calculated.

### 8. Visualizing Training Performance
- **Accuracy and Loss Plots**: Display the model's performance on both training and validation data over epochs.

### 9. Model Predictions and Evaluation
- **Confusion Matrix**: Shows correct and incorrect classifications for each digit.
- **Classification Report**: Provides precision, recall, and F1-score for detailed evaluation.

### 10. Sample Predictions Visualization
- Sample predictions are plotted with actual and predicted labels to visually verify model performance.

## üîç Key Observations and Learnings

- **Data Preprocessing** is critical in improving model performance. Reshaping and normalizing images, along with one-hot encoding labels, prepares data for efficient CNN training.
- **Model Architecture**: The combination of Conv2D, MaxPooling, and Dense layers forms a powerful CNN that can effectively learn patterns in image data.
- **Visualization of Metrics**: Plotting accuracy and loss helps detect overfitting or underfitting trends early on.
- **Model Evaluation**: The confusion matrix and classification report reveal which digits are most accurately classified and where the model struggles.

## üìà Summary

In this project, we built a CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras for classifying hand-written digits. We preprocessed the data by reshaping and normalizing it, and constructed a CNN architecture with Conv2D layers for feature extraction, MaxPooling layers for size reduction, Dense layers for decision-making, and Dropout layers to mitigate overfitting.

- **Libraries Chosen**: TensorFlow and Keras are user-friendly and highly efficient for creating neural networks, while Seaborn and Matplotlib enhance visualization. Sklearn assists in evaluating model performance with a confusion matrix and classification report.

Our CNN achieved notable accuracy on the test set, demonstrating effectiveness in digit classification. This project can be further improved with additional data, hyperparameter tuning, or more complex architectures.
